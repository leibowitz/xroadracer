!!!NOT-UPDATED!!

(0.1) Firt Version Milestone : To be implemented/fixed, in preference order.

_ Implement the physics.(TODO)
	When two cars overlap, it should be considered as an hit. Depending on 
	the both cars rotating axes and speed, it should react properly.(Basic collision reaction implemented, thanks to the code from Andrew @ Trophy.sf.net) 
	
_ Better Artifical Intelligence.(TODO)
	It should not break when it can accelerate without crossing the line.
	Should learn by driving. In most cases this is a per map basis. 
	
_ Modify some code to get a clean image rotating engine.(DONE)
	The car is only one bitmap that is rotated by the sge_transform. This 
	doesn't keep the alpha channel and thus break the transparency. So a 
	new function is called, clear_background to get rid of the light blue 
	color that represent the transparency on the car bitmap. (Fixed)
	When two cars are running, this is dumb and makes poor results. (Fixed)

_ Add the sound engine to the game.(NOTHING DONE)
	This will be an huge contribution. I don't know exactly how to do this. 
	All I know is the theory of a car engine sound in game. You take a 
	basic "vroom" at constant speed, and then you pitch up/down the 
	sound to get an acceleration/deceleration.

_ Draw tires burnout.(TODO)
	When accelerating or when the player is turning heavily (at high speed)
	there should be black lines on the road staying ten or more seconds. 
	
_ Implement the race code as a module.(TODO)
	There should be many race type. So it will be better to clean up the 
	code and to seperate the race code from the rest. Thus making the 
	creation of new race type easier.
	
_ Create a menu and implement everything needed (basic implementation done).
	Before starting the race, the player should choose what race type he 
	want to play.
	In the menu = 
		. switch between fullscreen / windowed mode (use 'F' key) 
			-> new implementation to be done
		. change the resolution (640x480, 800x600, 1024x768) -> TODO
		. change the bitmap (8,16,24) -> TODO
		. set the keys or joystick controls -> (started)
		. choose the race type -> code (TODO)
			| arcade
			| cup
			| career
 
_ Implement in-game multilanguage support (TODO)
	Every text displayed in game, or in the menu should be i18n.

_ Creations list / NOT CODE RELATED /
	째 Create more maps, test them, makes them work with the AI.
		-> map editor almost finished. This will speed up the creation of 
		new races
	째 Draw more cars.
		-> Michael is already working on this.
	째 Show on the website a complete "map making" from the map_creating.xcf
		-> see the documentation.odt and the web directory.
	째 Provide a special download for the Map Developement Kit.
		-> this will only be necessary for advanced contributors, 
		because a basic implementation of the map editing is being done.
